Identification System 

--> Signup options: student, teacher, tutor 

STUDENT: 
  - name, school name

TEACHER: 
  - name, school name, ID card 

  System will first compare submitted ID card with verfied ID cards at the claimed school 
    --> Similar = first stage pass, then perform teacher-response-test (within 1-3 days, verified teachers in the school and vote on the new teacher's acceptance)
    --> Less than 25% say No --> accepted, else rejected 

  If the school is not heard of, it will first do the real-school check 
    --> fail = denied 
    --> pass = automatically becomes accepted
